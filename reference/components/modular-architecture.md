# Modular and Extensible Architecture

NewPush Labs is designed with a modular and extensible architecture, allowing for easy customization and expansion of the lab environment.

## Key Concepts

1. **Microservices**: Each component of the lab is designed as a separate microservice, allowing for independent scaling and updates.

2. **Container Orchestration**: Utilizes container orchestration (e.g., Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) for efficient management of services.

3. **API-First Design**: All components expose APIs, enabling easy integration and extension.

4. **Plugin System**: Supports plugins for adding new functionality without modifying the core system.

## Extending the Lab

### Adding New Services

To add a new service to your lab:

1. Create a Docker image for your service
2. Define the service in your Docker Compose file or Kubernetes manifest
3. Configure networking and storage as needed
4. Deploy the service using Portainer or your preferred container management tool

### Creating Plugins

To create a plugin:

1. Develop your plugin following the NewPush Labs plugin API specifications
2. Package your plugin as a Docker container
3. Add the plugin to your lab's configuration
4. Deploy the plugin alongside other services

## Customization Options

- **Theming**: Customize the look and feel of the Web UI
- **Workflows**: Create custom workflows to automate tasks across multiple services
- **Integrations**: Integrate external tools and services with the lab environment

## Best Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege when adding new services or plugins
- Document all customizations and extensions for easier maintenance
- Regularly review and update custom components to ensure compatibility with the core system
- Use version control for tracking changes to your lab configuration
