# Docker Labels

Docker labels are a powerful feature that allows you to add metadata to your Docker images, containers, and other Docker objects. This metadata can be used for various purposes, such as organizing, managing, and querying Docker objects. Labels are key-value pairs that you can define and attach to your Docker objects.

## Using Docker Labels in Docker Compose Files

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You can use Docker labels to add metadata to your services, networks, and volumes. This can help you manage and organize your Docker environment more effectively.

### Adding Labels to Services

To add labels to a service in a Docker Compose file, use the `labels` key under the service definition.
