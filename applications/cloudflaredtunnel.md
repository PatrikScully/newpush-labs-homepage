## Description
Cloudflare Tunnel provides you with a secure way to connect your resources to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP address. With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP â€” instead, a lightweight daemon in your infrastructure (cloudflared) creates outbound\-only connections to Cloudflare's edge.

Requires a token in order to work. You can find the dashboard [here](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/). Once you logged in, go to Access followed by Tunnels. Create a tunnel. After you gave it a name you'll see in the command section a long string of chacters. This is your token you must copy.
