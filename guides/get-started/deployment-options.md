# Deployment Options

NewPush Labs offers flexible deployment options to suit your lab environment needs.

## Local Deployment 

Set up and run the lab on your local machine. This option is perfect for those who prefer to have full control over their environment and resources. You can customize the setup according to your preferences, install necessary tools, and work offline without any dependency on internet connectivity. This method is ideal for developers who want to experiment in a controlled and isolated environment.

With cloud deployment, you can quickly scale resources up or down based on your requirements, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. Additionally, cloud providers offer various services and integrations that can enhance your lab experience, such as automated backups, monitoring, and security features.
