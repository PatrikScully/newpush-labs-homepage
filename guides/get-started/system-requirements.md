# System Requirements

For the lab setup, it is essential to have a dedicated virtual machine running the latest version of Debian. This ensures that the environment is consistent and isolated, providing a stable platform for all the necessary tools and dependencies. By using a dedicated virtual machine, you can avoid conflicts with other software and configurations on your host system, leading to a smoother and more reliable experience during the lab exercises.

## Hardware Specs

To ensure optimal performance and compatibility, please make sure your virtual machine meets the following minimum system requirements:

| Component       | Requirement            |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Operating System| Debian 12 "bookworm"   |
| CPU             | 2 Cores                |
| RAM             | 2 GB                   |
| Disk Space      | 25 GB                  |
| Network         | Public IPv4 Address    |

## Software Specs

For provisioning the lab, you can use a machine running macOS, Linux, or Windows. Regardless of the operating system, you will need to have Ansible installed to manage the setup process. Additionally, it is possible to provision the lab directly on the localhost of the virtual machine.

### Supported Operating Systems

| Operating System | Version                |
|------------------|------------------------|
| macOS            | 10.15 "Catalina" or later |
| Linux            | Any modern distribution |
| Windows          | 10 or later            |

### Required Software
| Software         | Version                |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Ansible          | 2.9 or later           |
| Git              | 2.20 or later          |

Ensure that your system meets these requirements to avoid any issues during the lab setup process.
